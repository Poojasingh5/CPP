# Linked Lists

## What are linked lists?
- Linked lists are a collection of elements which are randomly stored in the memory.
- Linked lists are made up of *nodes*. A node is a structure which consists of two parts (in the most basic version). One part consists of information/data that is to be stored in a list. Second part consists of the address of the next node. This second part forms a link between all the nodes, making the list, a *linked* list.
- Linked lists are used to implement data structures like stacks, queues and trees.

## What are the advantages of using linked lists?
- Linked lists are dynamic in nature - meaning that you can expand or shrink the size of a linked list according to your necessity.
- Easier insertion and deletion - Inserting or and deleting an element in a linked list is relatively easier as compared to arrays.

## What are the disadvantages of using linked lists?
- More memory is required as compared to arrays.
- Traversing a linked list backwards (reverse traversing) is not possible in case of a normal linked list. Though, backward traversing is possible in doubly linked lists.
- Random access is not possible like it is in arrays.
