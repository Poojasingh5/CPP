# Stacks

## What are stacks?
- A stack is a data structure which is basically a single-ended collection of elements. The two operations of stack are - push (to insert/push elements into the stack) and pop (to remove/pop elements from the stack). Both these operations take place from the same end.
- A stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out) structure. That just means that the first elenent to go in is the last element to come out, and, the last element to go in is the first to come out.
- We can compare this stack to the pile of plates in the kitchen sink. The first plate to go into the sink is the last one to get washed; the last plate to go into the sink is the first on to get washed.

## Applications of stack - 
- Used wherever a reverse output is desired.
- Used for evaluating expressions.
- Used in backtracking algorithms.
