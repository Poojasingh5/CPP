# Queues

## What are queues?
- A queue is a data structure which follows the FIFO rule (i.e. First In First Out). The first element that goes into the queue is the first element to come out. The last element to go into the queue is also the last element to come out.
- It is just as the name suggests. It is a collection of elements in the form of a queue/line. The rear end is where elements are inserted. The front end is from where the elements are removed.
- We can compare this queue to the queue outside any ticket counter. The first person to stand in line is the first person to get the ticket. The last person in line gets the ticket last. So, people get removed from the queue from the front end, and new people join the queue at the rear end.

## Applications - 
- Used whenever we want the output to be in the same order as the input.
- Task scheduling in shared resources (like printers).
