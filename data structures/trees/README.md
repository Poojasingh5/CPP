# Trees

## What are trees?
- Trees are a non-linear type of data structure. They generally represent a normal tree (only inverted, i.e. with the root at the top!). 
- According to Wikipedia, in computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

## Tree Terminology
- **Node** - A structure which contains a value.
- **Root node** - A root node is the topmost node of the tree.
- **Child node** - A node which is linked to a parent node is called a child node.
- **Parent node** - Consider a node that has two child nodes. The top node is the parent of these two child nodes.
- **Ancestor node** - The nodes above the parent nodes of a child node are called the ancestor nodes of the child node.
- **Leaf node** - A node which has no child node.
- **Internal node** - A node that has child nodes.
- **External node** - A node that does not have child nodes (i.e. leaf node).
- **Degree of a node** - A degree of a node is the total number of its children.
- **Degree of a tree** - The highest degree of any node in the tree.
- **Width** - The number of nodes in a level.
- **Breadth** - The number of leaves of the tree.
- **Size of a tree** - Total number of all the nodes in the tree.

## Types of trees -
1. Binary Trees
2. Binary Search Trees
3. Red-Black Trees
4. Expression Trees
5. B-Trees
6. AVL Trees  .......etc.
