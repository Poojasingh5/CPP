# Bubble Sort (aka Sinking Sort)

## What is bubble sort?
Bubble sort is the easiest way of sorting elements in an array. It traverses the array, compares the adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## What is the algorithm for bubble sort?
Let's consider that we want to sort some elements in an array in ascending order.
- Step 1: Start with the element at the first position (0th index). Compare it with the element at the second position (1st index). If first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
- Step 2: Repeat step 1 until end of the array is encountered.
- Step 3: Repeat the same procedure for the remaining iterations until the array is sorted.

## Features of bubble sort
- Very simple
- Not very efficient on a large group of elements
