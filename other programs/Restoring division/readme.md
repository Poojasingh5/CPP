### Restoring Division algorithm using C++ 
```Restoring division algorithm``` is used to divide two decimal numbers by converting them into binary and performing several operations in a cycle. 
- The total number of cycles are equal to the number of bits we use. 
- It comes under the **slow division algorithm** 
This program takes two inputs from the user- ```Dividend``` and ```Divisor``` 
The output displayed is the ```Quotient``` and ```Remainder``` in binary form. 

**The following is the algorithm for Restoring Division**
